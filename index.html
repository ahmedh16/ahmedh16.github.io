        <div class="text"><H1>Bangladesh</H1><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka" target="_blank"><strong>Dhaka</strong></a>, the capital city of Bangladesh epitomizes a tale of two cities. One hand, there is the hustle and bustle of a thriving megacity with high growth rates. On the other hand, there is the severe presence of abject poverty within the urban sphere. Since the late 1990s, Bangladesh has become a global hub for the international textile-manufacturing sector. It has established itself as a competitive global player with the assistance of liberalized foreign direct investment (FDI) policy and cheap labor cost, which possibly is the most attractive feature of the Bangladeshi export market. In the last 15 years, the level of foreign investment has increase significantly. In 2000, the total foreign capital inflow was around $280 million USD. Whereas, in 2013, FDI inflow amassed at around $1.5 billion USD. The investments are flowing in from both the western nations and other Asian countries. Greater employment opportunities have flourished as a result of the increased capital inflow. However, it also means that a greater number of individuals start to relocate to the urban areas to avail these newly established opportunities.<br><br><img class="image" src="http://ahmedh.neocities.org/IMG_2976.jpg" alt="Dhaka City During Moonsoon Season" width="1000px" height="100%"> <br> <br>Currently, Dhaka City has a population of about 15 million. 80% of the manufactured exported good are produced within the confines of greater Dhaka City. Most of the employment options in manufacturing sector consist of low paying service jobs. As a result, the migrant workers are reliant on informal low-income housing options for their shelter. However, proper low-income housing is nearly non-existent in Dhaka. As of now, the only government sponsored low-income housing is available to the low-tiered public sector workers. Slums are the only option for most new city dwellers and well over one third of Dhaka Citys population reside in slums. Similarly, 35% of Dhakas population live below the poverty line. The conditionsof the slums are highly precarious, as there are high risks for water-borne diseases due to ill sanitary conditions. Thus, there is a dire need for formalized low-income housing in order to ensure the long-term wellbeing of the migrant workers.<br> <br><img  src="http://ahmedh.neocities.org/IMG_2606.jpg" alt="Dhaka City During Moonsoon Season" width="1000px" height="100%"><br><br>The Government of Bangladesh (GOB) can leverage on the fact that due to the increased foreign capital inflow in the future, the demand for public housing is bound to increase significantly. GOB should see this as a window of opportunity to find international assistance for funding various subsidized low-income housing projects in Dhaka City to relieve the pressure of the slums. One way to solve the problem could be through public private partnerships with the foreign investors, which can have certain levels of cost sharing mechanisms to diversify the risks that comes along with such capital-intensive projects. Moreover, other forms of assistance can be gathered from multi-lateral sources such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. In general, both the international community and the domestic actors of Bangladesh has a huge stake in textile manufacturing sector, which not only supply;s clothing to its global clients but it is also the bread and butter of Bangladesh's economic growth. Therefore, it is imperative to focus on the issue of low-income housing, as it is directly correlated with the ongoing urbanization and the growth of the Bangladeshi economy. </p>  </div>
